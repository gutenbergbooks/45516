THREE-AND-SIXPENNY
LIBRARY OF BOOKS
BY POPULAR AUTHORS

Crown 8vo.


_This Series, which comprises over four hundred volumes in various
departments of Literature, has lately received some notable additions.
Prominent among these is a new and attractive edition of_ The Works
of Thackeray, _issued under the editorship of Mr. Lewis Melville.
It contains all the Original Illustrations, and includes a great
number of scattered pieces and illustrations which have not hitherto
appeared in any collected edition of the works._ The Works of
Charles Dickens, _reprinted from the first editions, with all the
Original Illustrations, and with Introductions, Biographical and
Bibliographical, by Charles Dickens the Younger, and an attractive
edition of_ The Novels of Charles Lever, _illustrated by Phiz and
G. Cruikshank, have also a place in the Library. The attention of
book buyers may be especially directed to_ The Border Edition of
the Waverley Novels, _edited by Mr. Andrew Lang, which, with its
large type and convenient form, and its copious illustrations by
well-known artists, possesses features placing it in the forefront of
editions now obtainable of the famous novels._ The Works of Mr. Thomas
Hardy, _including the poems, have also been recently added to the
Three-and-Sixpenny Library. Among other works by notable contemporary
authors will be found those of_ Mr. F. Marion Crawford, Rolf
Boldrewood, Mr. H. G. Wells, Gertrude Atherton, Mr. Egerton Castle,
Mr. A. E. W. Mason, Maarten Maartens, and Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey;
_while among the productions of an earlier period may be mentioned the
works of_ Charles Kingsley, Frederick Denison Maurice, Thomas Hughes,
_and_ Dean Farrar; _and the novels and tales of_ Charlotte M. Yonge,
Mrs. Craik, _and_ Mrs. Oliphant.


THE
WORKS OF THACKERAY

_Reprints of the First Editions, with all the Original Illustrations,
and with Facsimiles of Wrappers, etc._

Messrs. MACMILLAN & CO., Limited, beg leave to invite the attention
of book buyers to the Edition of THE WORKS OF THACKERAY in their
Three-and-Sixpenny Library, which, when finished, will be the
Completest Edition of the Author's Works which has been placed on the
market.

The Publishers have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr.
LEWIS MELVILLE, the well-known Thackeray Expert. With his assistance
they have been able to include in this Edition a great number of
scattered pieces from Thackeray's pen, and illustrations from his
pencil which have not hitherto been contained in any collected edition
of the works. Mr. Melville has read all the sheets as they passed
through the press, and collated them carefully with the original
editions. He has also provided Bibliographical Introductions and
occasional Footnotes.

SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

     _TIMES._--"It would be difficult to find in these days a more
     competent and sympathetic editor of Scott than his countryman, the
     brilliant and versatile man of letters who has undertaken the task,
     and if any proof were wanted either of his qualifications or of his
     skill and discretion in displaying them, Mr. Lang has furnished it
     abundantly in his charming Introduction to 'Waverley.' The editor's
     own notes are judiciously sparing, but conspicuously to the point,
     and they are very discreetly separated from those of the author, Mr.
     Lang's laudable purpose being to illustrate and explain Scott, not to
     make the notes a pretext for displaying his own critical faculty and
     literary erudition. The illustrations by various competent hands are
     beautiful in themselves and beautifully executed, and, altogether,
     the 'Border Edition' of the Waverley Novels bids fair to become the
     classical edition of the great Scottish classic."

     _SPECTATOR._--"We trust that this fine edition of our greatest and
     most poetical of novelists will attain, if it has not already done
     so, the high popularity it deserves. To all Scott's lovers it is
     a pleasure to know that, despite the daily and weekly inrush of
     ephemeral fiction, the sale of his works is said by the booksellers to
     rank next below Tennyson's in poetry, and above that of everybody else
     in prose."

     _ATHENÆUM._--"The handsome 'Border Edition' has been brought to a
     successful conclusion. The publisher deserves to be complimented on
     the manner in which the edition has been printed and illustrated, and
     Mr. Lang on the way in which he has performed his portion of the work.
     His introductions have been tasteful and readable; he has not overdone
     his part; and, while he has supplied much useful information, he has
     by no means overburdened the volumes with notes."

     _NOTES AND QUERIES._--"This spirited and ambitious enterprise has been
     conducted to a safe termination, and the most ideal edition of the
     Waverley Novels in existence is now completed."

     _SATURDAY REVIEW._--"Of all the many collections of the Waverley
     Novels, the 'Border Edition' is incomparably the most handsome and
     the most desirable.... Type, paper, illustrations, are altogether
     admirable."

     _MAGAZINE OF ART._--"Size, type, paper, and printing, to say
     nothing of the excessively liberal and charming introduction of the
     illustrations, make this perhaps the most desirable edition of Scott
     ever issued on this side of the Border."

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"There is absolutely no fault to be found with it,
     as to paper, type, or arrangement."

SOME PRESS OPINIONS OF THE THREE-AND-SIXPENNY ISSUE

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"... their charming edition of the
     works of Thomas Hardy ... the price asked for it ... is
     absurdly cheap.... Any more convenient and beautiful form
     of presentation for these books it would be difficult to
     find."

     _ATHENÆUM._--"This edition is so comely and so moderate in
     price that it may well placate those who have sighed for
     earlier issues out of their reach. Mr. Hardy's prefaces
     to the volumes should not be missed, for they are models
     of a difficult art, whether reflective, informative, or
     combative."

THE NOVELS OF
F. MARION CRAWFORD

MR. ISAACS: A Tale of Modern India.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"A work of unusual ability.... It fully
     deserves the notice it is sure to attract."

DOCTOR CLAUDIUS: A True Story.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"Few recent books have been so difficult to
     lay down when once begun."

A ROMAN SINGER.

     _TIMES._--"A masterpiece of narrative.... Unlike any other
     romance in English literature."

ZOROASTER.

     _GUARDIAN._--"An instance of the highest and noblest form
     of novel.... Alike in the originality of its conception
     and the power with which it is wrought out, it stands on a
     level that is almost entirely its own."

MARZIO'S CRUCIFIX.

     _TIMES._--"A subtle compound of artistic feeling, avarice,
     malice, and criminal frenzy is this carver of silver
     chalices and crucifixes."

A TALE OF A LONELY PARISH.

     _GUARDIAN._--"The tale is written with all Mr. Crawford's skill."

PAUL PATOFF.

     _ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE._--"Those who neglect to read _Paul
     Patoff_ will throw away a very pleasurable opportunity."

WITH THE IMMORTALS.

     _SPECTATOR._--"Cannot fail to please a reader who enjoys
     crisp, clear, vigorous writing, and thoughts that are alike
     original and suggestive."

GREIFENSTEIN.

     _SPECTATOR._--"Altogether, we like _Greifenstein_
     decidedly--so much so as to doubt whether it does not
     dislodge _A Roman Singer_ from the place hitherto occupied
     by the latter as our favourite amongst Mr. Crawford's
     novels."

TAQUISARA: A Novel.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Cannot fail to be read with interest
     and pleasure by all to whom clever characterisation and
     delicate drawing make appeal."

A ROSE OF YESTERDAY.

     _SPEAKER._--"There is something in _A Rose of Yesterday_
     which makes the book linger with a distinct aroma of its
     own in the reader's memory."

SANT' ILARIO.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"The plot is skilfully concocted, and the
     interest is sustained to the end.... A very clever piece of
     work."

A CIGARETTE-MAKER'S ROMANCE.

     _GLOBE._--"We are inclined to think this is the best of Mr.
     Marion Crawford's stories."

KHALED: A Tale of Arabia.

     _ANTI-JACOBIN._--"Mr. Crawford has written some stories
     more powerful, but none more attractive than this."

THE THREE FATES.

     _NATIONAL OBSERVER._--"Increases in strength and in
     interest even to the end."

THE WITCH OF PRAGUE.

     _ACADEMY._--"It is so remarkable a book as to be certain of
     as wide a popularity as any of its predecessors; it is a
     romance of singular daring and power."

MARION DARCHE: A Story without Comment.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"Readers in search of a good novel may be
     recommended to lose no time in making the acquaintance of
     Marion Darche, her devoted friends, and her one enemy."

KATHARINE LAUDERDALE.

     _PUNCH._--"Admirable in its simple pathos, its unforced
     humour, and, above all, in its truth to human nature."

THE CHILDREN OF THE KING.

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"Mr. Crawford has not done better than
     _The Children of the King_ for a long time. The story
     itself is a simple and beautiful one."

PIETRO GHISLERI.

     _SPEAKER._--"Mr. Marion Crawford is an artist, and a great
     one, and he has been brilliantly successful in a task in
     which ninety-nine out of every hundred writers would have
     failed."

DON ORSINO.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"_Don Orsino_ is a story with many strong
     points, and it is told with all the spirit we have been
     wont to expect from its author."

CASA BRACCIO.

     _GUARDIAN._--"A very powerful story and a finished work of art."

ADAM JOHNSTONE'S SON.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"Mr. Crawford has written stories richer
     in incident and more powerful in intention, but we do not
     think that he has handled more deftly or shown a more
     delicate insight into tendencies that go towards making
     some of the more spiritual tragedies of life."

THE RALSTONS.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"The present instalment of what promises to be
     a very voluminous family history, increasing in interest
     and power as it develops, turns upon the death of Robert
     and the disposition of his millions, which afford ample
     scope for the author's pleasantly ingenious talent in
     raising and surmounting difficulties of details."

CORLEONE: A Tale of Sicily.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"A splendid romance."

VIA CRUCIS: A Romance of the Second Crusade.

     _GRAPHIC._--"A stirring story."

IN THE PALACE OF THE KING: A Love Story of Old Madrid.

     _SPECTATOR._--"A truly thrilling tale."

CECILIA: A Story of Modern Rome.

     _TIMES._--"Thoroughly interesting from beginning to end....
     Fully worthy of his reputation."

     _ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS._--"Can only enhance Mr.
     Crawford's reputation.... Admirably treated with all the
     subtlety, finesse, and delicacy which are characteristic of
     the author at his best."

MARIETTA: A Maid of Venice.

     _PUNCH._--"Marion Crawford is at his very best in
     _Marietta, A Maid of Venice_. It is a powerfully
     dramatic story of Venice under 'The Ten,' told in a
     series of picturesque scenes described in strikingly
     artistic word-painting, the action being carried on by
     well-imagined, clearly-defined characters."


THE NOVELS OF
ROLF BOLDREWOOD

ROBBERY UNDER ARMS.

A STORY OF LIFE AND ADVENTURE IN THE BUSH AND IN THE GOLD-FIELDS OF
AUSTRALIA.

     _GUARDIAN._--"A singularly spirited and stirring tale of
     Australian life, chiefly in the remoter settlements."

A MODERN BUCCANEER.

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"We do not forget _Robbery under Arms_,
     or any of its various successors, when we say that Rolf
     Boldrewood has never done anything so good as _A Modern
     Buccaneer_. It is good, too, in a manner which is for the
     author a new one."

THE MINER'S RIGHT.

A TALE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOLD-FIELDS.

     _WORLD._--"Full of good passages, passages abounding in
     vivacity, in the colour and play of life.... The pith of
     the book lies in its singularly fresh and vivid pictures of
     the humours of the gold-fields--tragic humours enough they
     are, too, here and again."

THE SQUATTER'S DREAM.

     _FIELD._--"The details are filled in by a hand evidently
     well conversant with his subject, and everything is
     _ben trovato_, if not actually true. A perusal of these
     cheerfully-written pages will probably give a better idea
     of realities of Australian life than could be obtained from
     many more pretentious works."

A SYDNEY-SIDE SAXON.

     _GLASGOW HERALD._--"The interest never flags, and
     altogether _A Sydney-Side Saxon_ is a really refreshing
     book."

A COLONIAL REFORMER.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"A series of natural and entertaining pictures
     of Australian life, which are, above all things, readable."

NEVERMORE.

     _OBSERVER._--"An exciting story of Ballarat in the
     'fifties. Its hero, Lance Trevanion, is a character which
     for force of delineation has no equal in Rolf Boldrewood's
     previous novels."

PLAIN LIVING. A Bush Idyll.

     _ACADEMY._--"A hearty story, deriving charm from the odours
     of the bush and the bleating of incalculable sheep."

MY RUN HOME.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"Rolf Boldrewood's last story is a
     racy volume. It has many of the best qualities of
     Whyte-Melville, the breezy freshness and vigour of Frank
     Smedley, with the dash and something of the abandon of
     Lever.... His last volume is one of his best."

THE SEALSKIN CLOAK.

     _TIMES._--"A well-written story."

THE CROOKED STICK; or, Pollie's Probation.

     _ACADEMY._--"A charming picture of Australian station life."

OLD MELBOURNE MEMORIES.

     _NATIONAL OBSERVER._--"His book deserves to be read in
     England with as much appreciation as it has already gained
     in the country of its birth."

A ROMANCE OF CANVAS TOWN, and other Stories.

     _ATHENÆUM._--"The book is interesting for its obvious
     insight into life in the Australian bush."

WAR TO THE KNIFE; or, Tangata Maori.

     _ACADEMY._-"A stirring romance."

BABES IN THE BUSH.

     _OUTLOOK._--"A lively and picturesque story."

     _DAILY TELEGRAPH._--"Bristles with thrilling incident."

IN BAD COMPANY, and other Stories.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"The best work this popular author has done
     for some time."

THE NOVELS OF
ROSA N. CAREY

Over Half-a-Million of these works have been printed.

47th Thousand.
NELLIE'S MEMORIES.

     _STANDARD._--"Miss Carey has the gift of writing naturally
     and simply, her pathos is true and unforced, and her
     conversations are sprightly and sharp."

33rd Thousand.
WEE WIFIE.

     _LADY._--"Miss Carey's novels are always welcome; they are
     out of the common run, immaculately pure, and very high in
     tone."

29th Thousand.
BARBARA HEATHCOTE'S TRIAL.

     _DAILY TELEGRAPH._--"A novel of a sort which it would be a
     real loss to miss."

25th Thousand.
ROBERT ORD'S ATONEMENT.

     _STANDARD._--"_Robert Ord's Atonement_ is a delightful
     book, very quiet as to its story, but very strong in
     character, and instinct with that delicate pathos which is
     the salient point of all the writings of this author."

32nd Thousand.
WOOED AND MARRIED.

     _STANDARD._--"There is plenty of romance in the heroine's
     life. But it would not be fair to tell our readers wherein
     that romance consists or how it ends. Let them read the
     book for themselves. We will undertake to promise that they
     will like it."

24th Thousand.
HERIOT'S CHOICE.

     _MORNING POST._--"Deserves to be extensively known and
     read.... Will doubtless find as many admirers as readers."

     _GUARDIAN._--"A thoroughly good and wholesome story."

35th Thousand.
NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Like all the other stories we have
     had from the same gifted pen, this volume, _Not Like Other
     Girls_, takes a sane and healthy view of life and its
     concerns.... It is an excellent story to put in the hands
     of girls."

     _NEW YORK HOME JOURNAL._--"One of the sweetest, daintiest,
     and most interesting of the season's publications."

24th Thousand.
MARY ST. JOHN.

     _JOHN BULL._--"The story is a simple one, but told with
     much grace and unaffected pathos."

23rd Thousand.
FOR LILIAS.

     _VANITY FAIR._--"A simple, earnest, and withal very
     interesting story; well conceived, carefully worked out,
     and sympathetically told."

28th Thousand.
UNCLE MAX.

     _LADY._--"So intrinsically good that the world of
     novel-readers ought to be genuinely grateful."

21st Thousand.
RUE WITH A DIFFERENCE.

     _BOOKMAN._--"Fresh and charming.... A piece of distinctly good work."

34th Thousand.
ONLY THE GOVERNESS.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"This novel is for those who like
     stories with something of Jane Austen's power, but with
     more intensity of feeling than Jane Austen displayed, who
     are not inclined to call pathos twaddle, and who care to
     see life and human nature in their most beautiful form."


24th Thousand.
LOVER OR FRIEND?

     _GUARDIAN._--"The refinement of style and delicacy of
     thought will make _Lover or Friend?_ popular with all
     readers who are not too deeply bitten with a desire for
     things improbable in their lighter literature."

21st Thousand.
BASIL LYNDHURST.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"We doubt whether anything has been
     written of late years so fresh, so pretty, so thoroughly
     natural and bright. The novel as a whole is charming."

22nd Thousand.
SIR GODFREY'S GRAND-DAUGHTERS.

     _OBSERVER._--"A capital story. The interest steadily grows,
     and by the time one reaches the third volume the story has
     become enthralling."

24th Thousand.
THE OLD, OLD STORY.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"Miss Carey's fluent pen has not lost its
     power of writing fresh and wholesome fiction."

24th Thousand.
THE MISTRESS OF BRAE FARM.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Miss Carey's untiring pen loses none
     of its power, and her latest work is as gracefully written,
     as full of quiet home charm, as fresh and wholesome, so to
     speak, as its many predecessors."

12th Thousand.
MRS. ROMNEY and "BUT MEN MUST WORK."

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"By no means the least attractive of
     the works of this charming writer."

_New Impression._
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES.

     _BRADFORD OBSERVER._--"There is a quiet charm about this
     story which finds its way into the innermost shrines of
     life. The book is wholesome and good, and cannot fail to
     give pleasure to those who love beauty."

25th Thousand.
HERB OF GRACE.

     _WESTMINSTER GAZETTE._--"A clever delineator of character,
     possessed of a reserve of strength in a quiet, easy,
     flowing style, Miss Carey never fails to please a large
     class of readers. _Herb of Grace_ is no exception to the
     rule...."

20th Thousand.
THE HIGHWAY OF FATE.

     _BOOKMAN._--"This pretty love story ... is charming,
     sparkling, and never mawkish."

19th Thousand.
A PASSAGE PERILOUS.

     _TIMES._--"Told with all Miss Carey's usual charm of quiet,
     well-bred sentiment."

     _OUTLOOK._--"A pretty story of English country-house life
     during the terribly anxious 'waiting days' of Ladysmith.
     The soldier's young bride is charmingly suggested and the
     love portions approach the idyllic."
