<h3>SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"It would be difficult to find in these days a more competent
and sympathetic editor of Scott than his countryman, the brilliant
and versatile man of letters who has undertaken the task, and if any proof
were wanted either of his qualifications or of his skill and discretion in
displaying them, Mr. Lang has furnished it abundantly in his charming
Introduction to 'Waverley.' The editor's own notes are judiciously sparing,
but conspicuously to the point, and they are very discreetly separated from
those of the author, Mr. Lang's laudable purpose being to illustrate and
explain Scott, not to make the notes a pretext for displaying his own
critical faculty and literary erudition. The illustrations by various competent
hands are beautiful in themselves and beautifully executed, and, altogether,
the 'Border Edition' of the Waverley Novels bids fair to become the
classical edition of the great Scottish classic."</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"We trust that this fine edition of our greatest and
most poetical of novelists will attain, if it has not already done so, the high
popularity it deserves. To all Scott's lovers it is a pleasure to know that,
despite the daily and weekly inrush of ephemeral fiction, the sale of his
works is said by the booksellers to rank next below Tennyson's in poetry,
and above that of everybody else in prose."</p>

<p><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>&mdash;"The handsome 'Border Edition' has been brought
to a successful conclusion. The publisher deserves to be complimented
on the manner in which the edition has been printed and illustrated, and
Mr. Lang on the way in which he has performed his portion of the work.
His introductions have been tasteful and readable; he has not overdone
his part; and, while he has supplied much useful information, he has by no
means overburdened the volumes with notes."</p>

<p><i>NOTES AND QUERIES.</i>&mdash;"This spirited and ambitious enterprise
has been conducted to a safe termination, and the most ideal edition of the
Waverley Novels in existence is now completed."</p>

<p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&mdash;"Of all the many collections of the
Waverley Novels, the 'Border Edition' is incomparably the most handsome
and the most desirable.... Type, paper, illustrations, are altogether
admirable."</p>

<p><i>MAGAZINE OF ART.</i>&mdash;"Size, type, paper, and printing, to say
nothing of the excessively liberal and charming introduction of the illustrations,
make this perhaps the most desirable edition of Scott ever issued on
this side of the Border."</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"There is absolutely no fault to be found
with it, as to paper, type, or arrangement."</p>

<p class="center"><b>ROBBERY UNDER ARMS.</b><br />

A STORY OF LIFE AND ADVENTURE IN THE BUSH AND IN THE
GOLD-FIELDS OF AUSTRALIA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"A singularly spirited and stirring tale of Australian life, chiefly
in the remoter settlements."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>A MODERN BUCCANEER.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"We do not forget <i>Robbery under Arms</i>, or any of its
various successors, when we say that Rolf Boldrewood has never done anything so good as
<i>A Modern Buccaneer</i>. It is good, too, in a manner which is for the author a new one."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>THE MINER'S RIGHT.</b><br />
A TALE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOLD-FIELDS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;"Full of good passages, passages abounding in vivacity, in the colour
and play of life.... The pith of the book lies in its singularly fresh and vivid pictures
of the humours of the gold-fields&mdash;tragic humours enough they are, too, here and again."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>THE SQUATTER'S DREAM.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>FIELD.</i>&mdash;"The details are filled in by a hand evidently well conversant with his
subject, and everything is <i>ben trovato</i>, if not actually true. A perusal of these cheerfully-written
pages will probably give a better idea of realities of Australian life than could be
obtained from many more pretentious works."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>A SYDNEY-SIDE SAXON.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>GLASGOW HERALD.</i>&mdash;"The interest never flags, and altogether <i>A Sydney-Side

<p class="center"><b>NEVERMORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>OBSERVER.</i>&mdash;"An exciting story of Ballarat in the 'fifties. Its hero, Lance
Trevanion, is a character which for force of delineation has no equal in Rolf Boldrewood's
previous novels."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>PLAIN LIVING.</b> A Bush Idyll.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"A hearty story, deriving charm from the odours of the bush and the
bleating of incalculable sheep."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>MY RUN HOME.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>&mdash;"Rolf Boldrewood's last story is a racy volume. It has many of
the best qualities of Whyte-Melville, the breezy freshness and vigour of Frank Smedley,
with the dash and something of the abandon of Lever.... His last volume is one of his
best."</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>THE SEALSKIN CLOAK.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"A well-written story."</p>

<p class="center"><b>A ROMANCE OF CANVAS TOWN</b>, and other Stories.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
